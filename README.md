# Thought Tagging

This is a front-end only, web-app for segmenting audio-recordings into separate *thoughts*. It's built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/), [Peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js), and uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store data.

## Branch details

This branch differs from others in that it was designed to be used by a single person not through mturk. It guards the experiment with a password (known to that person).
