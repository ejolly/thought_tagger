# Thought Tagging

This is a front-end only, web-app for segmenting audio-recordings into separate *thoughts*. It's built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/), [Peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js), and uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store data.

# Developing  

## Getting setup

2. `cd` into the `thought-tagging` folder
3. run `npm install` to setup the app dependencies on your local machine (you only need to do this once)
4. start a local server to edit interact using `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:5000`
